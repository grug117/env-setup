# Env Setup

contains scripts and config needed for making setting up new system easier.
all scripts are debian based as they use `apt-get` as the package manager, for use with fedora, etc commands can mostly be swapped 1-1 with `dnf` commands

### Execute permissions to scripts
```
chmod -R +x ./*.sh
```
